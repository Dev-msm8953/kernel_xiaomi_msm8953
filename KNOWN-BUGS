KNOWN BUGS
==========

After end of 4.9-stable maintenance, I try to further maintain
our 4.9 Oneplus kernel tree. I try to fix as many bugs as possible,
but sometimes a backport from mainline is not feasible or not done
by the stable team, and sometimes backport from 4.14-stable to our
4.9 kernel tree is not feasible or not done for other reasons.

Not applicable changes are not listed below.

I'll try to add notes here:

4.14.303:

35529d6b827ee | nfc: pn533: Wait for out_urb's completion in pn533_usb_send_frame()

4.14.308:

71da2a151ed1a | rbd: avoid use-after-free in do_rbd_add() when rbd_dev_create() fails
